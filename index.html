    <h1>The Jain Book Club</h1>
    <p id="textstyle">ðŸ“š Jain Book Club is a dynamic initiative within our school that celebrates the spirit of reading, discussion, and
    discovery through the lens of Jain values. Rooted in the principles of non-violence, truth, and compassion, the club
    encourages students to explore Jain scriptures, stories, and contemporary writings that inspire thoughtful living.
    Through engaging meetings, book reviews, and collaborative activities, the club cultivates a love for literature while
    promoting mindfulness and ethical awareness. Itâ€™s a nurturing space where curiosity meets cultureâ€”and every reader grows
    wiser, page by page.</p>
